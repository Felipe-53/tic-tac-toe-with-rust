# Tic-Tac-Toe with Rust

A simple terminal based implementation of the classic game, built as part of my learning journey with rust.

I'm more or less a third of the way through the [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) and decided to give this project a shot.

This is actually my very first project with the language and I have to say: what an amazing experience!
